 *       Description: Compute the absolute pose of a camera using three 3D-to-2D correspondences.
 *    Modifications form original:
 *                   Using the Eigen linear algebra library instead of the TooN library that Laurent Kneip used in his original implementation.
 *                   Output data as a vector of poses, as opposed to the large 3x16 matrix output by original implementation by Laurent Kneip.

 *                  Absolute Camera Position and Orientation
 *
 *           Input: featureVectors: 3x3 matrix with UNITARY feature vectors (each column is a vector)
 *                   worldPoints: 3x3 matrix with corresponding 3D world points (each column is a point)
 *                   solutions: A vector of 4 elements where each element is a 3x4 matrix that contains the solutions
 *                                      of the form:
 *                                      [[3x4] (3x3 orientation and 3x1 position (solution1));
 *                                       [3x4] (3x3 orientation and 3x1 position (solution2));
 *                                       [3x4] (3x3 orientation and 3x1 position (solution3));
 *                                       [3x4] (3x3 orientation and 3x1 position (solution4))]
 *                               The obtained orientation matrices are defined as transforming points from the camera to the world frame
 *          Output: int: 0 if correct execution
 *                  -1 if world points aligned/colinear
